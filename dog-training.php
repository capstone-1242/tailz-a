    <h2>Puppy Training</h2>

    <p>The early months of a puppy are critical to them, as early socialization and care will heavily reduce fears and anxieties affecting them in the future.</p>

    <p>Early socialization and desensitization leads to decreased fears and anxieties down the road. Whether your puppy visits us once a week, or every day, they will get to experience our structured curriculum that focuses on socialization to sights, sounds, and experiences that they'll need to navigate life as an adult.</p>

    <p>These are programs that go beyond the traditional benefits of Doggy Daycare for our youngest pups. So whether you bring them once a week or every day, they will have the positive experiences that are pivotal in creating that healthy and happy member of your family.</p>

        <p>
            Helping to shape puppies, our Puppy Daycare program focuses on the socialization of puppies. We'll work on polite playtime, potty training, crate training, and socialization to help your puppy learn skills for everyday life.
            All puppies under 16 weeks must start in one of our Puppy Programs before moving up to our regular Doggy Daycare program.
            Puppies can start as young as 8 weeks old.
            Puppies must attend once a week for 4 weeks.

        <h2>requirements</h2>

        <p>
            Puppies must have their first Distemper Combination and Bordetella vaccination at least 7 days prior to their first day of Puppy Preschool, and must be kept up to date during their time at Tailz.‚Äã 
            While it used to be recommended that puppies not be socialized until after their third set of puppy vaccines at 16 weeks, research now shows us that waiting this long can be at the detriment of their social skills, and the risk of diseases is quite low if they have received their first or second set of vaccinations.

        <h2>FAQ</h2>
        <p>
            ü¶¥ When do the Puppy Programs run?</p>
        <p> Our Puppy Program curriculum runs Monday ‚Äì Friday and will start at 9:00am. Although our curriculum doesn‚Äôt start until mid-morning, you can drop off your puppy as soon as we open at 6:30am, and pick-up at our latest time of 6:30pm.
        </p>

        <p>ü¶¥ Should I bring lunch?</p>
        <p>We recommend that you bring your puppy lunch. Please send a single serving lunch in a clearly labeled bag or container.</p>

        <p>ü¶¥ Will treats be given?</p>
        <p>To aid in training, your puppy may also be given treats throughout the day, which we will provide. Our treats are typically quite tasty for the young pups; however, if you have particular treats that your puppy loves, you can bring those in a clearly labeled bag. We will use those for one-on-one training sessions. Be sure to let us know if your puppy has any food allergies or sensitivities.</p>

        <p>ü¶¥ Does my puppy have access to water?</p>
        <p>Your puppy will have access to fresh, cold water during each structured playtime.</p>

                are
                skip dates, e.g., for Holidays). This structure means that your puppy will have time to get to know
                their
                classmates since it will be the same puppies each week, and that you‚Äôll have a chance to build on the
                skills
                learned in previous weeks.

            <h2>GROWLY DOG CLASSES</h2>
            <p>
                Is your dog barking, growling, snapping, or snarling at other dogs or people out on walks? Do they
                frequently
                overwhelm other dogs when they try to say hello? Our Growly Dog classes are specially designed for dogs who
                need
                some extra help with their social skills, and use methods that will help keep you and your dog (and
                passers-by!)
                safe and happy.
            </p>
            <p>
                In Growly Dog classes or in private training, you will learn tactics to keep you and your dog safe right
                away,
                as well as how to teach your dog appropriate alternative behaviors. Our end goal is to help dogs learn to
                manage
                their social needs without aggression so that you don‚Äôt have to constantly keep them distracted from their
                triggers.
            </p>
            <p>
                At Tailz we understand that Growly Dogs are not bad dogs, and their owners are not bad owners! Our trainers
                are
                highly educated and have experience with dog to dog aggression and dog to human aggression. We look forward
                to
                helping rehabilitate both your dog‚Äôs behavior and your relationship with them.
            </p>
            <p>
                The first step for most Growly Dogs is to attend our Fear and Aggression 101 class, which will help you
                understand why your dog might be growly, what to do about it, and what you‚Äôll learn in the Growly Dog
                classes.
                If your dog has been aggressive with people, it may be most appropriate to start with private training to
                keep
                your dog and other students safe. Please contact us if you aren‚Äôt sure about where to start!

                    Dogs over react to other dogs out of fear, frustration or aggression. The Reactivity Evaluation class
                    includes the fake dog test which will help you understand more about the emotions underlying your dog‚Äôs

                    We‚Äôll start these classes with a check in and answer any questions that came up over the course from the
                    past week. Next, we‚Äôll have you practice the skills you‚Äôve learned with the other students in the class
                    so
                    that your dog can be exposed to other dogs at a safe, controlled distance. The focus during these weeks
                    is
                    to hone your training technique and adjust our recommendations based on what‚Äôs working for you and your
                    dog,
                    and gradually shrink their ‚Äúbubble‚Äù (the distance at which they‚Äôre comfortable with other dogs).

            <p>Taking a scientific approach to solving problem behaviours.</p>
        </div>
        <p>
            When dog's behaviour is out of the "normal range", it requires extra guidance from skilled trainers who
            specialize in dog behaviour and owners who are devoted to the success of their companions.
            In these circumstances, it is crucial drop the stigma and know it is okay to ask for help. Training your pup
            needs to be a lifestyle and a life-long commitment. Open yourself up to learn THE WHY your pup may be
            behaving
            this way which will allow you to understand THE HOW to help your pup in order to get results.
        </p>

        <p>
            During the Canine Skill Building process, we need to figure out your goals for your pup. Two different
            households can be looking for different results. Ultimately, we want you to be able to answer a few
            fundamental
            questions:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>How do I help them achieve my goal for them?</li>
            <li>How much time and effort am I willing to commit to their success?</li>
        </ol>

        <p>
            All these factors, affect the outcome. Canine Skill building is not just training ‚Äì it‚Äôs a learning process
            for
            both you and your pup. Throughout the process, you will be systematically given tools to help your pup build
            the
            skills they need to improve their behaviour.
        </p>
        <p>
            Training happens through repetition. It is through Skill Building
            that learning occurs as a sensory experience. It's more holistic - one in which all your dog‚Äôs senses are
            activated in a rich and robust way. Skill Building will deepen your relationship with your dog.
        </p>

        <p>
            After your initial consult, our trainer will thoughtfully develop a plan for ongoing skill enhancements,
            structure and one-on-one support.
