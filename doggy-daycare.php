    <section class="requirements">

        <h2>Requirements</h2>

        <p>
            All puppies under 16 weeks must start in one of our Puppy Programs before moving up to our regular Doggy Daycare program.
            Spay and Neuter: Pets over 7 months of age must be spayed and neutered. Our management team may grant exceptions with written medical reasons from your pet’s veterinarian for pets up to 10 months of age.
            Puppies are encouraged to join prior to being altered, as this is their best socialization time.
        </p>

        <h3> Vaccinations</h3>

        <p>
            Required Vaccinations (6+ months): Rabies, Distemper Combo & Bordetella.  A complete set of vaccinations during your pups lifetime is still required prior to any exceptions granted.
            We ask that each pup have the distemper combo as well as the Bordetella vaccination for canine cough prevention to begin doggy daycare.
            Vaccination requirement exceptions require written medical reasons by your pup's Veterinarian and proof of titer tests every 6 months. Any approvals for exceptions are handled on a case-by-case basis and are not guaranteed. Management will review any request for exception before to their Meet & Greet, and will consult with veterinarians prior making any decision
        </p>

        <h3>Pest Management</h3>

        <p>It is strongly recommended for your pet to be on monthly anti-parasite medication such as Revolution or Advantage, as this will greatly reduce the risk of spreading ticks, fleas, and lice to the facility and to your pup. Ask your veterinarian or purchase from over-the-counter</p>
